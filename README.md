## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizaniftikharjanjua/metaverse-financial-transactions-dataset) (licensed under CC BY 4.0).
This dataset is shared by the Open Metaverse, a collaborative initiative dedicated to the advancement and democratization of virtual worlds. For more information, visit (https://www.openmv.org/).
This dataset provides blockchain financial transactions within the Open Metaverse, aiming to provide a rich, diverse, and realistic set of data for developing and testing anomaly detection models, fraud analysis, and predictive analytics in virtual environments. With a focus on applicability, this dataset captures various transaction types, user behaviours, and risk profiles across a global network.
## Objectives 

The main objective of this project is:
> **To develop a system that will be able to detect behaviour and fraud analysis in blockchain transactions**

To achieve this objective, it was further broken down into the following 5 technical sub-objectives:
1. To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis of both datasets (tabular and graph)
2. To engineer new predictive features from the available graphs
3. To develop a supervised model to classify behaviour into normal and anomalous
4. To recommend a threshold that will perform better than the present baseline (ALGO-X) in terms of F1 score
5. To create an API endpoint for the trained model and deploy it
## Main Insights
From the exploratory data analysis, we found out that anomalous behaviour patterns are characterised by:
1. Insight about anomaly high_risk #1
2. Insight about anomaly moderate_risk #2
3. Insight about anomaly low_risk #3
